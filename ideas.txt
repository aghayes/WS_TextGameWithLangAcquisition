The targeting of this project may be more limited then initially thought. I think it will be helpful for
the subset of blind children that display echolalia after basic typing skills have already been aquired.
One question is how can this be applied to other children who display speech delay and disfunction?
Would autistic children who suffer from reversals and in some cases echolalia be a good target as well?
The broader the target audiance the better. So I definetly will be looking at who else the project can
be tailored to with minimal to medium effort. The ultimate goal would be easily interchangable parts
and processes for use across several demographics.

blind children tend to use internally focused language over external language.
	--maybe a party based game to help with the use of externally focused language?--

"frozen phrases" are common. Which as far as I understand is essentially using whole phrases instead of
constructing them with their own independent meaning from analzyed words. This however happens early in
language acquisition so it isn't really a good thing to address with this project.

This info is from the 80s and seems to be some what conterdicted by the above:
	Methods to help counteract:
		object
		verb + object
		agent + verb + object

		Maybe have party members do something to adjective objects.

		"wh" (presumably who, what, where, and why) questions are supposedly more difficult:
			yes and no questions are more likely to be answered correctly. I am unsure on
			wether that means we should avoid or focus on "wh" questions.
			
			the literature suggest the use of a third party prompter to help in the
			response. This seems ideally suited to the game. The use of a prompt for what
			to say is specifically suggested. This means that the use of a prompter to
			communicate what to type is not simply something that we have to tolerate
			instead it is something that is actively encouraged and should be emphasized
			or at least in no way mitigated.
		
		fill in questions when coupled with "phonetic clues" are easy but of limited
		communicative value.
		
		delayed echolalia may have to do with a precieved similarity between the current
		situation and past situations from which the phrasing is drawn.
			helpful strategies include "conceptual discrimination" of the situation as
			well as alternative forms of the phrases.
			
			--Several form of each command as well as perhaps well defined times to use
			each command--
		
		intervention should be three pronged:
			positive reinforcement for verbal interactions (function)
			
			giving models for appropriate language (form)
			
			facilitation of the development of concepts (content)

"low constraint language models" I think stuff thats kind of open ended? These are the examples given:
	comments
	
	affirmations
	
	reflective questions.

Low constraint language is language that doesn't place a ton of pressure on the respondent such that
either no specific or no response at all is neccesary.
	I should look for this for more information appearantly Rydell & Mirenda, 1991

	delayed echolalia was more common with low constraint interaction the echolalia also was more
	linguistically useful and showed more evidence of comprehension.
